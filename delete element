% Base case: If the list is empty, then the result is also an empty list.
delete(_, [], []).

% If the element to be deleted is the head of the list, then skip it and recursively process the tail.
delete(X, [X|T], Result) :-
    delete(X, T, Result).

% If the element to be deleted is not the head of the list, keep the head and recursively process the tail.
delete(X, [H|T], [H|Result]) :-
    X \= H,
    delete(X, T, Result).
